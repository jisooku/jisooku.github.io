# Impact of the Rise in Corporate-Owned Rental Properties

### Background Information
The Charlotte Observer illustrated stories in May 2022 to show the impact of large corporations purchasing single-family homes across the country focusing in North Carolina. The authors of the article suggest that “at least 40,000 single-family properties are now held by about 20 companies”, and this is expected to increase as companies are seeing more profits and the state of the housing market in North Carolina. It has been very easy to sell homes in North Carolina and very hard to purchase one because of the growing presence of large corporations. For instance, the authors shared a story of a realtor who was able to sell multiple homes within the first day of listing by the name of ‘SFR JV-2 Property LLC”, even bidding prices above the asking price. Companies like this, and AMH 2015 2 Borrower LLC are subsidiaries set by large corporations like American Homes 4 Rent and Progress Residential as regional offices in each state to purchase homes, while these corporations are in the form of ‘investors’. Another Charlotte realtor, Jonathan Osman expressed his concerns that both selling and buying homes were very difficult during the housing crisis, and the situation has completely flipped in recent years. These corporates are not reselling the houses that they purchased, instead they are renting these out to the people. Osman further explained that “the number-one way we transfer wealth and accumulate wealth is through real estate ownership, there’s equity that is going to corporations that could have been going to people.” In short words, these corporations are taking money away from people by reducing ways to generate income for families. Additionally, the following data is my authentic work and not provided by the Github article. 

Owner 
- AMH NC PROPERTIES LP: 4300
- IH6 PROPERTY NORTH CAROLINA: 1029
- FKH SFR PROPCO A LP: 796
- SFR JV 1 2021 1 BORROWER LLC: 708
- AMH 2015 2 BORROWER LLC: 676

Investor
- AMERICAN HOMES 4 RENT: 8309
- INVITATION HOMES: 5751
- PROGESS RESIDENTIAL: 5725
- AMHERST RESIDENTIAL: 4595
- FIRST KEY: 4165

These numbers may be shocking to see with their large number of homes that each of these companies have purchased over the years. However, some corporations have set up multiple regional companies to diversify their portfolio. For instance, both #1 and #5 companies listed above are owned by the same corporation or ‘investor’: American Homes 4 Rent. Below list shows the top investors with the most homes in North Carolina. Since the regional companies are all backed by the funding of large corporations/investors, this paper will take a deep dive on these companies.

This graph is derived from a dataset provided by the article and I analyzed this data on RStudio to create this graph. This graph shows the total number of homes purchased in North Carolina by companies. The graph suggests that there is a steady increase from 2012 to 2020 then there is a spike in 2021. This was likely impacted by COVID-19 when people were in need of money in hand due to layoffs, and the large corporations listed above were taking advantage of this face. Now that COVID-19 is relatively over, these ex-homeowners are forced to rent a house in the area or move out of the neighborhood because the companies are reluctant to sell the house again.

This graph suggests how much these companies spent to purchase the homes. The two graphs are very similar in correlation because they are directly related. The dip of number in 2022 is assumed from the discontinuation from the dataset where it likely ended in the middle of the year. However, this graph shows how much the corporations invested their money during COVID-19 to take advantage of after COVID-19 ended. It is clearly working as they own multiple houses in each neighborhood in the top cities that they invested in. It seems like the corporations were targeting the middle class at their lowest point financially. This led the corporations to gain a system of rental monopoly especially because the housing supply is the same, while the demand is increasing. 


### Who are they targeting?
Here is where problem arises. None of these companies are from North Carolina and they are targeting middle class households who has little to no power to fight against the large corporations. According to the Statista, North Carolina’s median income was $65,070. The top five cities that these companies bought homes in were: Raleigh, Winston-Salem, Greensboro, Clayton, and Gastonia City. Out of these five cities, Raleigh had the highest household income with $69,000 per year, and the city with the lowest household income was Winston-Salem with $47,000 per year. Furthermore, all of these cities were not part of the twenty cities with the highest household income. This means that middle class is the main target for the large corporations to purchase houses in because they know that this is the socio-economic class with the most renters. This makes the middle class vulnerable from housing. However, I would like to acknowledge that the large corporates are not necessarily committing illegal actions. Average middle-class household cannot afford to build a house; therefore, these families have to rely on companies that they are renting from to secure housing. 

City 
- Raleigh: 2577
- Winston-Salem: 1535
- Greensboro: 1375
- Clayton: 1300
- Gastonia City: 860

### Challenging Ethical Issues
Homes and properties are the biggest source of equity that middle-class individuals will have for the rest of their life. By the companies buying up houses to rent, these people cannot amass wealth by renting. For example, houses are often handed down generationally when people decease, and this could be a rare occurrence in near future as people are not owning properties. Therefore, middle-class families are going to lose out on money with inability to purchase a property. Although this is not racially motivated, this argument relates to how people of color, during the segregation era, was prohibited to purchase properties by law. 

This is an ethical dilemma because these companies are not only just buying houses from the middle class (which benefits them), but also is harmful to them because these companies are not selling these houses again to the public. Specifically, the realtor license test covers ethics to serve “duties to clients and customers” and “duties to the public”. Ultimately, the principles of the real estate code of ethics discusses not misleading and practicing honesty to clients. Although the corporations are not entitled to practice these ethics, they should still practice ethics as corporations providing service to the American people and as landlords. They still have to practice the ethics of serving the public interest, instead of taking advantage of the middle class by forcing them to rent not buy. A great example could be shown in Irvine, California. The city of Irvine was a ranch, which turned out to be one of the fastest growing cities in the country. This was enabled because Irvine Company, who used to own the ranch, started building the city and selling it back to the American citizens. For example, they would build homes and apartment buildings and sell all the units out to the public, instead of owning and renting them. Irvine, CA, is my hometown and I believe that the company has done its best to serve the interest of the public. 

If these corporations start targeting the low-income households, this will become an even bigger issue. For instance, when companies invest in low-income housing, the government gives them tax breaks. From the external perspective, this looks very good on paper and it helps the company’s public relations because it seems like they are giving back the people in need. However, the fact that the companies are doing this because of tax reasons is often not publicized. 

### Potential Solution
Eventually, these corporations are going to buy enough homes to the point where there is a shortage of homes to purchase. Some might argue that these people can just move away where there is a big market of homes available to purchase. However, this is not always feasible. Going back to the first paragraph of this paper, there are residents in North Carolina living in corporate owned rental house. These families wish to purchase their homes from the corporations, but the corporations are not selling these homes, and these people cannot just leave the place they call home. In order to solve this problem, any level of government should pass a policy to prevent corporations to ‘over-purchase’ single family out and protect the middle class by giving them rights to purchase homes not limited by the corporation’s presence in the area. Here are some of the policies that could be effective:
1. Limit the number of houses that can be purchased by the corporations within a county. This will increase the level of competition between the corporations because the number of available homes that could be purchased by them will be severely limited, considering the high number of companies in the industry. The increased competition will drive the cost of rent down because of the nature of the competitive market. 
2. Single family houses should not be purchased by corporations for rental purposes. Companies are only permitted to renovate then resell, or build the house from ground up then rent out the property. Build Own Rent or Build Own Sell is something that Irvine Company practices, and it is proven to be effective without drawing controversy.
3. Banks should not be able to lend money to these corporations that are part of the rental monopoly. Banks lend money at a lower rate to these corporations than the average American. By either prohibiting the loans to these corporations or increasing the rate of interest significantly should help alleviate the monopoly.
